## Emmett McBain's design papers  
Using the collection of Emmett McBain's design papers from 1961 to 2000, I will research the difference between art for advertisement and art for creative expression. Questions of ethics, consumerism, and artist/audience relationships will be explored as I compare medicinal ads to music album covers to cigarette and skincare ads. Collage can be a helpful tool for this research as I can juxtapose the images, texts, and subjects together on one surface as well as isolate the components of the ads to find connections in Emmett McBain's art and designs.
