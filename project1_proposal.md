# UIC Archives Project Proposals  

## Emmett McBain's design papers  
Using the collection of Emmett McBain's design papers from 1961 to 2000, I will research the difference between art for advertisement and art for creative expression. Questions of ethics, consumerism, and artist/audience relationships will be explored as I compare medicinal ads to music album covers to cigarette and skincare ads. Collage can be a helpful tool for this research as I can juxtapose the images, texts, and subjects together on one surface as well as isolate the components of the ads to find connections in Emmett McBain's art and designs.  

## Suburbia and the American Dream  
For this project I will explore the rise of suburbs and the domestic American dream and its influence on women's roles, cloaked racism and segregation, and today's ideas of ideal living situations and communities. By exploring images, political cartoons, and advertisements from the postwar era I hope to gain a better understanding of how our communities and neighborhoods were formed and segregated and how that led to current individualistic, noncommunal societies. With this research, I will determine how the American dream has adapted and changed and how it impacts the formation of our neighborhoods today.  

## Terry Evans' Finding Objects  
Part of the CITY 2000 archive of thousands of photographs documenting Chicago in the year 2000, Terry Evans collects and labels objects found around the city offering a unique perspective of its life and culture. By researching Evans collection of objects, I will discover how objects are significant in observing and determining culture of different time periods and how human life can be found within these found objects. To add on to this archive of human artifacts, I will create my own collection of found objects within the city that will reveal how Chicago culture has changed or remained the same and contemplate how this project might look in the year 3000.
